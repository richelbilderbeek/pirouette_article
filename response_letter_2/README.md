We are glad to know that our revisions went in the right direction. We thank 
you and the reviewers for your help with that. The 3 main points you mentioned
above have been addressed (among the others) in the point by point response.

We agree: we underaddressed the coalescent model and now mention these
more frequent in the Introduction.

% 00009
Indeed, the implemented tree priors for the twinning process are Yule
and BD, yet a user can also specify any way how to simulate a twin tree,
such as, for example, one that uses a coalescent model. We mention this
explicitly in the 'Twinning' subsection.

Agreed! We have done so.

Completely agree. We have added an interpretation to each (set of) figure(s).

In 7 out of 19 cases, indeed, the best candidate model is the Yule
model. And we think that is an interesting point you bring up: 
that the method may be unable to distinguish between Yule and BD
for extant trees. We have added this to the manuscript.

[RSE: State where you do this.]

For us, creating a sampling-through-time tree is not
straightforward, therefore we decided not to test this, also
because we felt this is beyond describing what pirouette does.


[GL: Actually the figure in the supplementary at 8.11 was actually incorrect.
The correct one still shows similar median values but the shape of distributions
are different] 
[RJCB: What do you mean with 'was actually incorrect'?]

We think this a great suggestion and we rewrote the article to
use the term 'baseline model' for the 'true' pipeline.
For the 'twin' pipeline, however, the baseline model is the generative
model and we kept using the word 'generative' there.
[RSE: I am not convinced by this change of terminology, but let's see how the ms turns out.]
[GL: It looks to me like it could be a lot of work for no signicative improvement.]

[RJCB: note that it probably should follow that we adapt the figures' labels.
This would demand quite some calculations]

We used the name 'guidelines for empiricists' from a suggestion by another
reviewer. We have renamed to 'guidelines for users'.

 * [x] Done

> l563: Figure 8.6 does not exist

We mistakenly referred to the section instead of the figure. We corrected
this. Now we refer to the right figure: Figure 4.

> Figure 4: the true tree is top left, not top right

We have reworded accordingly.

 * [x] Done!

[RSE: Why is it so difficult to change the figures? It does not require new simulations, does it?]
[RJCB: Actually, it would require new sims]
[
  RJCB: I agree with the reviewer. Why don't we have approx 40 bins
  as in the pretty figures? Well, I see here, which I quote from 'pir_plot.R':

  ```
  ##### More aesthetic settings for the plots #####

  n_errors <- length(unique(df_long$error_index))
  bindwidth <- 0.1 / sqrt(n_errors)
  ```

  I would enjoy `pir_plot` to have more aesthetic settings.

  OTOH, Giovanni should first finish his PhD, and re-running takes time
  that I also need for my current job.
  
  [GL: Completely agree!]

  In the end: I suggest to give a lame excuse.

> In this article, Bilderbeek and colleagues present a piece of software that can assess the adequacy of a hierarchical model of tree, clock, and molecular substitution. Their effort is worthwhile and the manuscript is largely well-written, and with a few changes it should be a useful tool for power-users in phylogenetics.

We agree with the reviewer on the use of the word "importance". We
changed it in "impact", as already present in the literature
(see for example [1]).
We believe, instead, that the word "error" is not inappropriate here.
The "stochastic error" is one of the possible errors, but not the only one.
We clarified this in the description section adding the following
lines: "The error we aim to quantify is not of stochastic nature.
Stochastic errors are usually non-directional.
We, instead, aim to expose the bias due to the mismatch
between generative and inference models."

We agree that forcing a topology indeed has an effect. Still, we feel
this to be the lesser evil, as we feel that removing this contraint
makes an unfair comparison.

The topology may indeed be important. However, when topology contains no information to distinguish between the models, we prefer to use the same topology because we want the twin tree to be as similar as possible to the original tree. This is the case for the comparisons we consider: DD vs BD, or BD vs Yule.
However, to stress the importance that topology might have in other cases, we mentioned the issue both in the twinning section ("We choose to preserve the original topology to increase the similarity between the twin to the original tree. This works well in the cases of the birth-death or diversity-dependent models we consider in our examples. However this might not be suited for models in which branching times are strongly influenced by topology.") and in the discussion ("For models that make different predictions on topology, the twinning process should be modified in line with it").

Indeed, we ruthlessly moved Duchene's work the the discussion, only to save 
words, which was needed to make it to the deadline. In this rewrite,
we have had more time to properly refer to the literature, so we did
as you suggested.

[GL: In another comment he suggests to add it somewhere in Lines 76-81.

We rephrased point 3 in the abstract as following:
"We describe pirouette's usage providing full examples in which
we interrogate a model for its power to describe another."

'Libre' came form the abbreviation 'FLOSS' ('Free, Libre and Open Source 
Software'), as coined by Richard Stallman, where the 'L' helps
stress that the 'Free' is 'free as in speech', which can be translated
to 'Libre' (unlike 'free as in beer', which would be translated to 'Gratis').
But indeed, not everyone may value the addition of the 'L', so we removed it.

We rephrased the sentence as: "These simple tree priors

We rephrased the sentence as: "To allow users to extend the

and both tools are still developed independently."

Well spotted! Because we use the same defaults as BEAUti does (which does not
assume a rate heterogeneity), we overlooked this. We mention this is the

Indeed, in all cases we assumed a sampling fraction of 100 percent.
We mention that this may have an effect.

We have never used the expression 'mutation model'. We assume that
the reviewer refers to the use of the word 'mutation', used to
refer to the change of one nucleotide into
a different one. In such cases we replaced them with
the word 'substitution'.

We agree that this alignment looks different from what one normally finds
in the field. In this case, we simulated the alignments with the maximum
amount of information present. It can be viewed as only taking the SNPs
from an alignment.
