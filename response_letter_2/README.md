We agree: we underaddressed the coalescent model and mention these more now
in the Introduction [RJCB: 00002].
`pirouette` allows for any BEAST2 tree model in the regular pipeline.
In the twinning pipeline, where a 'most likely' (see 
equation 1) twin tree is simulated from
a true tree, the coalescent models are not implemented yet.
It can be put in by any user, by setting the 'sim_twin_tree_fun' (part 
of the 'twinning_params') to simulate a twin coalescent tree. Wouls someone
write that code, we would happily accept it in `pirouette`.

Agreed! We have done so.

Completely agree. We have added an interpretation to each (set of) figure(s).

In 7 out of 19 cases, indeed, the best candidate model is the Yule
model. And we think that is an interesting point you bring up: 
that the method may be unable to distinguish between Yule and BD
for extant trees. We have added this to the manuscript.

[RSE: State where you do this.]

For us, creating a sampling-through-time tree is not
straightforward, therefore we decided not to test this, also
because we felt this is beyond describing what pirouette does.


[GL: Actually the figure in the supplementary at 8.11 was actually incorrect.
The correct one still shows similar median values but the shape of distributions
are different] 
[RJCB: What do you mean with 'was actually incorrect'?]
[GL: At some point I mention an incorrect figure (in paragraph 8.11). Simply put: the figure that was in the previous version of the manuscript was not the one coming from the repo of the pirouette example. You can open the folder relative to that pirouette example in overleaf and check yourself the two figures. The old one is still there.]

We think this a great suggestion and we rewrote the article to
use the term 'baseline model' for the 'true' pipeline.
For the 'twin' pipeline, however, the baseline model is the generative
model and we kept using the word 'generative' there.
We hope you agree this is a good idea.
[RSE: I am not onvinced by this change of terminology, but let's see how the ms turns out.]

[RJCB: note that it probably should follow that we adapt the figures' labels.
This would demand quite some calculations]

### Minor comments

> Table 1: descriptions are missing for the error_fun section

Well spotted! We added these.

 * [x] Done

> l184: the model p_T is only defined in the caption of figure 1, 
> I think the definition needs to be repeated here

We did so:

```
The default option for the twin diversification model p_T 
is to use the standard BD model.
```

[RSE: Remove. Just say where you added the text]

 * [x] Done, 00003

> section 8.1: "Guidelines for empiricists" is a strange title since this

We used the name 'guidelines for empiricists' from a suggestion by another
reviewer. We have renamed to 'guidelines for users'.

 * [x] Done

> l563: Figure 8.6 does not exist

The figure that appears missing in section '8.6' is the one in the main
text. In a previous version, we put the
figure in the Supplementary Materials
as well, until a reviewer suggested to remove this duplication.

[RSE: Mention the correct figure number.]

> Figure 4: the true tree is top left, not top right

Well spotted! We have reworded accordingly.

 * [x] Done!

> some figures (e.g. fig 3, 8) have the distributions be partially transparent,

[RSE: Why is it so difficult to change the figures? It does not require new simulations, does it?]
[RJCB: Actually, it would require new sims]
[
  RJCB: I agree with the reviewer. Why don't we have approx 40 bins
  as in the pretty figures? Well, I see here, which I quote from 'pir_plot.R':

  ```
  ##### More aesthetic settings for the plots #####

  n_errors <- length(unique(df_long$error_index))
  bindwidth <- 0.1 / sqrt(n_errors)
  ```

  I would enjoy `pir_plot` to have more aesthetic settings.

  OTOH, Giovanni should first finish his PhD, and re-running takes time
  that I also need for my current job.
  
  [GL: Completely agree!]

  In the end: I suggest to give a lame excuse.

We agree with the reviewer on the use of the word "importance". We
changed it in "impact", as already present in the literature
(see for example [1]).
We believe, instead, that the word "error" is not inappropriate here.
The "stochastic error" is one of the possible errors, but not the only one.
We clarified this in the description section.
[RSE: You have to clarify it here. You can also copy the section. The point is that editors may just read the response letter and then decide instead of reading the whole ms again.]

  (1) RJCB: unsure if I agree.

For (2), we have reworded accordingly.

We agree that forcing a topology indeed has an effect. Still, we feel
this to be the lesser evil, as we feel that removing this contraint
makes an unfair comparison.
[RSE: State something like: "The topology may indeed be important. However, in the comparisons we consider, DD vs BD, or BD vs Yule, the topology contains no information to distinguish between the models. We have, however, added a sentence in the discussion [?] that for models that make different predictions on topology, the twinning process should be modified in line with this."]

Indeed, we ruthlessly moved Duchene's work the the discussion, only to save 
words, which was needed to make it to the deadline. In this rewrite,
we have had more time to properly refer to the literature, so we did
as you suggested.

[GL: In another comment he suggests to add it somewhere in Lines 76-81.

'Libre' came form the abbreviation 'FLOSS' ('Free, Libre and Open Source 
Software'), as coined by Richard Stallman, where the 'L' helps
stress that the 'Free' is 'free as in speech', which can be translated
to 'Libre' (unlike 'free as in beer', which would be translated to 'Gratis').
But indeed, not everyone may value the addition of the 'L', so we removed it.

Well spotted! Because we use the same defaults as BEAUti does (which does not
assume a rate heterogeneity), we overlooked this. We mention this is the

Indeed, in all cases we assumed a sampling fraction of 100 percent.
We mention that this may have an effect.

We have never used the expression 'mutation model'. We assume that
the reviewer refers to the use of the word 'mutation', used to
refer to the change of one nucleotide into
a different one. In such cases we replaced them with
the word 'substitution'.

We agree that this alignment looks different from what one normally finds
in the field. In this case, we simulated the alignments with the maximum
amount of information present. It can be viewed as only taking the SNPs
from an alignment.
