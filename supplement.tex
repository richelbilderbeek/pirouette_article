\section{Supplementary materials}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These supplementary materials show the full pipeline and
added diagnostics for the examples in the main article.

As in the main article, all the figures shown in this section are shown as-is, 
without any aesthetical modifications, with the exception that the arrangement
of the sub-figures (for example, aligning true and twin tree
horiztonally) is done manually.
